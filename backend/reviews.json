I had juice with no ice.\n\nI was happy to see that they are using glassware for all in-store drinks, rather than plastic cups. üëçüëçüëçüëç\n\nIt was October 19, and the shop owner gave all the women in my group a rose for Women‚Äôs Day. üòäüòä\n\nThere is adequate parking right in front of the shop.\n\nThe only downside is there is no toilet for customers.",

Perfect mix of sweetness and lemon flavor.\n\nTonight I had lychee and it is just as delicious and flavorful as the lemon tea.\n\nThey always put a nice amount of fruit into each cup, so you have something to munch on as you enjoy the drink.\n\nHighly recommend as a chill spot for a break from Vietnam hectic life and to hangout with friends after a busy day.",

I have had many milk teas and this one was the worst one I‚Äôve ever had. It tasted like sugar water and didn‚Äôt have many pearls in it. I went back and explained that there is no milk in the milk tea that I ordered and they said that it is powdered milk (which I still struggle to believe as it looked and tasted like water with sugar) and there is a different one on the menu that has real milk in it priced slightly higher. I said that what they gave me is not what I ordered. The staff made no attempt to correct the issue only saying that next time I should get a different one. I won‚Äôt be going back again. That is not how you do customer service.",

Only noticed it a few minutes later when we had already left with the food.\n\nSign outside said cone for 8, while price on menu was 10. Make up your minds.\n\nDon't waste your time here.

Service was exemplary. I didn‚Äôt like the wall-to-wall 2010s western pop music, however, which was unfortunate, because it was very loud.",

      "comment": "The reason I share this cafe shop is that there is a good price drink and friendly staff. It also was in a very nice location, near the City Zoo, which means we can sit both inside and outside. In other words, we can enjoy the cool air from AC in the hot day and fresh gentle breeze in cool day.\n\nIt also supports power outlets in case of our phones running out of battery.\n\nSo I would like to recommend you a cup of milk tea (or anything would pleasure you) before visiting the zoo. Have I mentioned that take-away is available?",

I would definitely come back next time. Though I would suggest adding some washroom since they only had one for unisex had to wait very long to use it.\n\nStaffs can speak good English!",

The cacao boba is normal, I do not recommend it.\n\nThe price is around > 70k/ one + topping.\n\nThe minus thing here is the WC is located in the next building. It's an officer so all the light is turned off, only the way you go to the WC. Very inconvenient and quite dangerous (personal opinion)",

The cream cheese topping tasted nice but i dont know what type of strawberry they used, it tasted so disgusting I nearly vomited. They need to remove this item from the menu or get better ingredients. Im not even exaggerating",

Take-out only, the shop is staffed by a friendly and professional team who are deaf. When you pull up on your motorcycle, they will greet you with a menu, notepad, and pen. Simply choose your drink, write it down, and send it back. They will let you know the price while preparing your order, and accept both cash and bank transfers.\n\nWhile the ordering process might seem unfamiliar at first, especially for new customers, the staff's meticulous preparation ensures every drink is a delicious experience. Do not hesitate to give it a try.",

They make the tea themselves; the toppings they buy ready-made.\n\nThey have a selection of drinks which are no sugar (‚Äòkh√¥ng ƒë∆∞·ªùng‚Äô) and another selection which are low sugar (‚Äò√≠t ƒë∆∞·ªùng‚Äô). Ask them which drinks these are, as the menu does not indicate that clearly.\n\nVery limited seating and motorbike parking, so customers are almost exclusively takeout; you can sit on your bike and they will bring out an umbrella for you (for both rain and sun protection) and take your order.\n\nEveryone is very friendly and prompt with the orders.",

It's definitely not about the money, it's about Principle. And I'm here very often and ate there and ordered a lot before. If you're a Foreigner, don't encourage this dishonest place. There is plenty of fantastic and honest Vietnamese locals with great businesses all around that are not treating us Foreigner with such disrespect and racism. Again, on Principle, never again.

I‚Äôd call it a local food vendor with decent quality and good value , just don‚Äôt expect too much.",

There's three and the dining area is in the third.\nOrdering can be challenging and there was only one person that spoke some English.\nTranslate and pictures from other people online can and will certainly help you as a tourist or non VN speaking person.\nI had a simple bbq porkchop over rice with some pickled vegetables for 38k vnd. A great price for a tourist but can't comment it from a local perspective.\nThe porkchop was amazing. Very well seasoned and loved the smoky flavor. Despite it not being cooked on order, the porkchop was very tender and not dry at all. Kinda wished I had asked for a double porkchop.\nThey forgot my iced green tea and getting the staff's attention is rather difficult. A lot of moving around but not actually looking around (general dining experience in these types of places).\nDid I mind it? Not at all, the meal had left me quite satisfied.\nDefinitely a place I would recommend if you're in the area.",

I love to come here for the cat fish soup ( has okras, vegetable and tomatoes ) with or without the cat fish ( with one piece of cat fish is 30.000 VND , without the cat fish is 15.000 VND . I love this place for lunch and dinner and this is part of the franchise restaurant chain and it has full siting area inside with full size chairs and tables ( you don‚Äôt need to sit in the little stools outside ! ).",

She couldn't stop talking about how incredibly tasty and generous the portions were ‚Äì definitely the best she's had!\nEverything from the professional, tidy, and super hygienic packaging to the food itself was top-notch. The C∆°m T·∫•m quality hit the spot. The pork chop and pork rib were perfectly seasoned, tender, and still incredibly juicy even after delivery. And that fish sauce? It was the ideal complement, bringing all the flavors together beautifully.\nEven the smaller details shone through: the sunny-side up egg was cooked to perfection, and both the seaweed soup and Vietnamese sour soup were delicious additions. We were all incredibly happy with the service and the entire experience.\nIf you don't mind spending extra for quality, this place really knows how to deliver a winning meal!",

Only the fatty rim was juicy.\nThey made an effort to make the place looks nice with wooden tables and stools, brick facade on the wall and a mix of real and plastic plants.\nPersonally I prefer the street side shop that grill it on coals, not sure if they do that here, couldn't see the grilling, though it didn't taste like it was.",

We actually like it better than a certain Michelin Guide one also in town. The meat is tender and soft here, rice seasoned just right. Also their side of soup has minced pork and seaweed.

      "comment": "This is a good sized, two-story spot offers a dining experience that combines convenience, comfort, and culture. You place your order on the main floor and then head upstairs to enjoy the air-conditioned seating area‚Äîa welcome retreat on a hot day. The service is efficient, with food arriving in about 5 minutes.\n\nThe decor is inviting, featuring the story of the restaurant beautifully displayed on the walls. The placemats double as guides, providing instructions on how to eat com tam (broken rice), which adds an educational touch for first-timers. The menu is also written in English, making it accessible to tourists. The upbeat music and thoughtful design create a comfortable, welcoming environment.\n\nAs for the food, it scores a solid 4/5. The pork rib was the highlight‚Äîjuicy, flavorful, and cooked to perfection. However, the pork cutlet was slightly dry, which took away from the overall experience. The accompanying soups were both delicious, adding depth to the meal. That said, we wished the plates came with more vegetables to balance out the richness of the meats.\n\nOverall, this restaurant is a great place for a quick, flavorful meal in a relaxed setting. A few tweaks, like juicier pork cutlets and a more generous vegetable portion, would make it exceptional.",

The pork chop is well-marinated and nicely grilled, with a good balance of flavors and less sweet than others. A generous portion with pork chop and egg costs 57K, which is a good deal for the quality.\n\nIt‚Äôs just about walking distance from Pham Ngu Lao, making it a great option if you want to escape the tourist-heavy areas and try something more local.

I have probably tried 50+ com tam stores across Vietnam, but this tops the rest. The meat is tender and marinaded perfectly and it is super tasty. I got a full topping for 55k, but without any topping is 35k. Even the toppings were excellent, so you wanna make it worth if you are making a trip here. They even served free tea with ice and that also separates from the rest of com tam stores.",

Their shredded pork skin lacked the satisfying crispness and the distinct toasted rice aroma. The portion size was meager, the rice undercooked with a rough texture, and there was no complimentary soup included. An additional VND 20.000 per cup buys you soup, but the selection rotates daily between just two options. On Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, the soup is made from pickled mustard greens and beef tendons. On Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday, there will be seaweed soup with pork cartilage.",

Although she doesn't speak English, she was super friendly and welcoming, she was so nice and checking up on me if I enjoyed the food and if I wanted to order anything else.\n\nDefinitely would recommend this place although it's quite far away from the city center!\n\nI spent vnd45k for my pork ribs option.",

The food tastes clean and simple‚Äînothing greasy or over-marinated. N∆∞·ªõc m·∫Øm is not too sweet or too thick.  It just goes so well w the rice and the meat. It reminds me of the c∆°m t·∫•m I had when I was little. Best of all, the price is about half of what usually charge at the popular broken rice restaurants.  üíõ",

They sell out super fast, so if you arrive around 10:30 AM, you might find them already packing up for the day.\n\nThere is a few seats lining the alley and some inside a house, but the pork chops are grilled right at the entrance to the alley. Hence, no smoke smell even the space is limited.\n\nThe pork chops look fantastic, but I found them a bit sour and chewy. I suspect the meat might have been marinated for too long or perhaps the charcoal was a bit too hot.\n\nOverall, the broken rice is decent value for money, and the ladies who run it are really friendly and welcoming.",

Everything went well together and I only regret not being able to stuff more of this lovely dish into my belly. the ice lemon tea is also not the usual taste you get but really good!!\n\nthis stall is a good symbol of street food, because you are literally on the street with a small table and toddler chairs (I‚Äôm 6‚Äù2 but I was still happy), i read another review about red ants in the area but i didn‚Äôt encounter that.\n\nMUST TRY! Highly recommend if you are in district 1!",

We had one dish with grilled pork chops and other dish with pork chops, pork skins and meat pie. Nouc Sam sauce and cooked chives are really good with the dish! They even included iced tea before the meal and fresh banana after!\n\nWe came at around 10am and they were consistently busy with local people doing takeaways. We walked 20mins and it was worth visiting!",

We ordered two broken rice, one with pork rib, skin and meat pie, and another with caramelised pork and eggs at only 125 thousand VND. Comes with soups and drinks. You can smell the grilled pork while you enjoy your meals. The staff are friendly and one of them can speak English. The only disadvantage is the settings are quite limited. Many ordered and take away. I feel that the food tastes better than restaurants.",

The dishes at this shop are especially good as they are still prepared and cooked in-house at the shop and not supplied by a central kitchen in a factory complex.\nBroken rice cuisine is a combination of grilled pork chop, cold cuts, pork skin, and egg cake (otherwise known in Vietnamese as \"suon, bi,cha\"). Do remember to eat the meal with a bowl of bitter melon soup.",

I visited this place after reading some good reviews, and it absolutely lived up to the hype.\nThe broken rice (c∆°m t·∫•m) here is flavorful and well-balanced. I tried the grilled pork chop with egg and pickled vegetables ‚Äî the meat was juicy and marinated perfectly, and the rice had a nice texture. The fish sauce (n∆∞·ªõc m·∫Øm) was delicious and not overly salty. Portion size was generous for the price.\nThe restaurant is clean, organized, and gives off a very local and authentic Saigon vibe. Staff were friendly, helpful, and served food quickly even during busy hours. Also, I loved how the menu was easy to understand even for non-Vietnamese speakers.\nIt‚Äôs conveniently located on 100 Th·∫°ch Th·ªã Thanh, just 8 minutes from the city center, and stays open until 10 PM ‚Äî perfect for late lunch or early dinner.\nHighly recommend this place to tourists and locals alike looking for a high-quality, affordable Vietnamese meal.",

So glad we came back for lunch today as it was delicious!\n\nWe were greeted by a friendly employee in English. We told him what we wanted. He offered to have an egg added to each of our plates which we definitely wanted. It's not listed on the menu but it looks like from other reviews they give it as an option upon ordering.\n\nWe took a seat and our food was served in under 5 mins. We did not order tea but it was brought to us. I'm not sure if we were charged for it but my husband said each of our meals cost about $80k.\n\nWe both ordered the honey pork chop which was so juicy and flavorful! Cannot wait to come back again.\n\nThere was nothing special about the atmosphere. Could have been cleaner but not unhygienic. You get what you pay for.",

It lists ‚Äúb√¨, ch·∫£, ·ªëp la‚Äù as 12k/1 ph·∫ßn, which implies that all three items together cost 12k. But when the bill comes, each item is charged separately.

Really cheap for what they give you.\n\nNone of the staff speak a word of English so just point. They're helpful though so that's great",

      "comment": "Reasonable prices (broken rice with grilled pork chop and another topping for VND 35.000). However, the crowdedness of the eatery is overwhelming. Even with a large staff of 7-9 people, service seems stretched thin. The hot and stuffy environment felt more suited for take-out. The watercress soup was particularly disappointing. The watercress itself seemed undercooked, and the broth lacked flavour. It appeared they prepared the soup by adding raw vegetables directly to bowls with premade clear broth, resulting in an unpleasant, pungent taste.",

The feeling was the same as one of the reviews.\nThe spare rib was a bit salty and without a good smell of honey, it was cool as usual as they normally grilled and then put them aside and wait for the order.\nIt costed me VND110.000 /115.000 and a total of VND130.000 including one fried egg and one cup of iced tea. And they didn‚Äôt even offer you a complimentary soup as of the other shops.\nI can‚Äôt image such a dish of food and environment costs me more than double or even triple the price if you eat in the local wet market.\nNo service , ordinary good , expensive price ‚Ä¶..",

There are several piles of pork meat sitting at the window to attract customers, thus when you come to the shop they pick one of the piece that's been sitting on the window to feed you. It's a cold and very tough piece of meat. The cha was mushy, like it was over cooked, no texture at all. I would never eat here again and would advise anyone I know to not try it.",

The fish sauce aroma is prominent, and there are some decorative green peppercorns and perhaps a hint of spice?\n\nSuon, Cha - Porkchop has a mild char and decent caramelization, and has a tasty sweet and savory marinade. Although, it‚Äôs a bit dry but not too tough, and has a lean texture. The egg meatloaf is a bit firmer and meatier than usually, which I appreciate for its leaner feel and clean pork umami, with an eggy aroma that you can actually taste, although it is missing woodear.\n\nSomeone was smoking inside though, which was rather unpleasant.",

The highlight of it was definitely the steamed egg cake, which is the best I've had, as it has real crab in it. The pork chop was dry, but had a good charcoal taste. It was definitely on the more expensive side at 120k (when normal prices I've seen around are closer to 45k). We also had iced coffee, which tasted pretty watered down and was overpriced at 25k (vs much better street food iced coffees)",

      "comment": "Regarding the issue of lengthy waiting times for food, the restaurant has received numerous complaints without apparent improvement. On Friday evening, I experienced this first-hand, enduring a wait of nearly an hour for just one of my three dishes. The remaining orders were similarly delayed and required repeated prompting. While the staff were apologetic and the food ultimately enjoyable, the restaurant would benefit from a review of its service procedures to enhance customer satisfaction. The drinks were merely adequate for quenching thirst; the strawberry tea had an artificial taste and sweetness, and the milk tea was excessively sweet, overpowering the tea flavour.",

While I understand that the staff may have been tired due to a busy day, I was disappointed by the lack of professionalism I encountered. The service felt unkind, which was surprising given the otherwise welcoming atmosphere of the restaurant.\nI recognize that this is not a 5-star establishment, but I believe that customer service should always reflect a high standard of professionalism. A more courteous and attentive approach would go a long way in enhancing the overall experience. I hope the management considers this feedback to improve the service quality for future guests.",

The noodles themselves were more or less tasty but...\nI was very disappointed that I asked for a 5 out of 7 on their spiciness scale and was hoping for a spicy dish that would make me sweat, they had 5-numb mind on the menu but the noodles were NOT spicy at all...\nWhen I asked what was wrong the waitress made an excuse that I didn't feel the spiciness because the dish had a creamy broth... I'll come back to try another dish but for now I'm disappointed.\nThey brought 3 cheese balls as a gift with the main course, they tasted simply disgusting and had nothing in common with cheese, never buy them here, they tasted like just starch.",

This pho restaurant is very well known thanks to its convenient location right on Hoang Sa Street. This is enough to make customers love it so much.\nUnlike regular pho restaurants that choose beef as the main ingredient, at Pho Be Thanh Da, it is cooked entirely from veal. The veal bones are stewed to make broth, the remaining meat is divided into small pieces and served in the veal pho dish.\n\nThe flavor of the restaurant's dishes is very rich, combined with the pho broth made from veal bones that have been stewed for many hours. Each bowl of pho is very carefully prepared from the pho broth to the arrangement of the ingredients in the bowl of pho, which is very eye-catching.\n\nThe typical flavor of Pho Be Thanh Da is a light sweetness at first, but later on it will make you addicted and miss it, it is a different flavor compared to many other pho flavors.",

Some of the reviews are very odd and I believe it's roasting from other companys. Some people give 1 star review in total but  say food 5* and Ambiente 5*  and service 1* so how can the total be 1 star then ?\n\nYou can see your Pho bowl been freshly made while you take a look through the glass window inside the shop. They also make the noodles fresh which isn't common at restaurants nowadays. The noodles therefore taste very fresh.\n\nIt's literally make your own pho. You get the base plus many herbs, vegetables and sauces to combine .\n\nYou can also order some drinks if you want I paid 95k for everything you see on the picture . The herbs are complementary.",

Maybe everyone else of the many reviews got way better, but what I received was brutal‚Ä¶ especially for ‚Ç´100k**\n\nI had the ‚ÄúC5‚Äù - ‚ÄúPh·ªü Th·ªë ƒê√°‚Äù - beef shank, well done flank, oxtail & beef ribs\n\n‚Äî\n\nLocal Vietnamese don‚Äôt use Google reviews much, so this scathing criticism is to help tourists who consider visiting here.\n\nFor me, good ph·ªü has good broth and good meat, and this had neither. A first for me eating ph·ªü in Mexico, the US and 6 months here in Vietnam.\n\n- broth lacked character, richness and nuance‚Ä¶ unlike SO many other bowls of ph·ªü here in Saigon, and they‚Äôre all 1/2 the price of this ‚Ç´100k tragedy in a bowl\n\n- meat pieces were chewy and nearly flavorless\n\nPROS:\n- Hot stone bowl\n- Air-conditioning\n- House-made noodles, but the benefit of rice noodles made in-house is far less than with Italian style pasta\n- Qu·∫©y - if you want this (breadsticks)\n\nCONS:\n- Bland, flavorless broth\n- Small portion of chewy, low-quality beef\n\n100% I do **not** recommend.\n\nThere‚Äôs TOO much amazing food in Saigon to settle for insipid, no-love, bland ph·ªü.",

Don't order the stone pot Pho, look around and see what the locals order and you'll see hardly anyone orders the stone pot Pho. Just order the regular Pho. Plus Pho are made with piping hot broth anyways so the broth is already really hot when you get it. So why would you want it boiling when you get your Pho. I would recommend this place if you like wide pho noodles.",

The day before, we had noodles with the Michelin Star, and we felt that their soup tasted better. But that‚Äôs not really a problem ‚Äî every restaurant has its own recipe. That‚Äôs just our personal opinion.\n\nHowever, what really disappointed me was that I think it was the owner‚Äôs daughter who came to collect the payment. The total was 505,000 VND, and I gave her 1,000,000 VND, but I was shortchanged by 90,000 VND. I never thought a restaurant like this would cheat even on the change. I went back to ask for the receipt again to double-check the prices because something didn‚Äôt feel right. The girl must have realized her mistake because she quickly came over, tapped me, and gave me the missing 90,000 VND.\n\nWe visit Ho Chi Minh City every year and feel that the country has developed a lot, with much less cheating nowadays.

Here they have the option to have it with crispy noodles, and for me they were absolutely perfect. It is definitely deserving of being on the Michelin guide, unlike many other spots.\n\nThe flavour of the gravy on the beef is amazing, and the accompanying homemade sauces on the table are delicious. Especially the chilli oil, which is slightly citrusy. I literally scraped the plate clean it was so delicious.\n\nThis is somewhere I would happily return to, and honestly say if you‚Äôre in Ho Chi Minh - then it is a MUST VISIT.\n\nAs it‚Äôs family owned, the vibe is also super friendly. They‚Äôre also very proud of what they‚Äôve built which is nice to see. The owner lady even gave us some free cake, which was the lightest fluffiest cake I‚Äôve ever had - so she‚Äôs a great cook and baker!!\n\nDefinitely go here, and try the Pho Xao , it‚Äôs a must.

When I visited this time, it was rainning so not so many customers were coming. Then I had Pho Tap Cam (all in), then it came within a minute!! The fastest serving in Michelin Pho Lol. Anyway, The pho was quite standard and tastes good. Perfect as standard but not special. The price is a bit pricy due to Michelin. If you are looking for the The Standard Ph·ªü, then it's nice place to visit.",

If you're in a rush, this spot is perfect for a quick, satisfying slurp.\n\nThe pho comes with a generous helping of lime, bean sprouts, and herbs‚Äîdefinitely a nice touch. That said, the broth leaned on the milder side for me. I have had pho that tend to be more aromatic and herb-forward, I found myself missing that fragrant depth.\n\nI ordered the mixed beef large bowl, but was a bit underwhelmed‚Äîonly one piece of each meat type, which left the bowl feeling more noodle-heavy than expected. Still, the portion of noodles was fair, and the overall bowl warm and comforting.\n\nThe space itself feels authentic, clean\n, with open fans circulating air and adding to the relaxed, street-side vibe. It‚Äôs not the most flavorful pho I‚Äôve had, but for speed and simplicity, it definitely delivers.\n\nVerdict: 3.5/5 ‚≠êÔ∏è, could have definitely be a 4 if the pho was bigger in portion for the ‚Äúlarge‚Äù size and more fragrant!",

      "comment": "I ordered the C2 hot-stone beef pho, which comes with raw beef slices and cooked beef brisket. On the side you get beef broth, scallions, bean sprouts, lemongrass, Thai basil, and fresh chili.\nThe taste is very close to the classic pho I‚Äôve had before. The stone bowl arrives piping hot, so you can cook the raw beef yourself, almost like a mini hot pot. Don‚Äôt rush it the way I did‚Äîif you add all the beef at once, it clumps together. Take your time and swish the slices in the broth for the best texture.\nThe fresh chili is seriously spicy, so add with care. The chili sauce on the table packs heat too. The broth here is noticeably fresher and a touch sweeter than what I‚Äôve had in Europe, and it tastes far less like MSG. European pho really does cut corners on slow-simmered stock.\nOverall, this bowl beats any pho I‚Äôve tried in Europe or Japan. I can‚Äôt compare it to local Vietnamese spots since this is the only one I‚Äôve tried so far, but I‚Äôll definitely explore more next time. The shop itself is small, clean, and welcoming, with plenty of foreign visitors. Both card and cash are accepted.",

The taste was so savory and rich. I loved it so much that I even went back again on my departure day with my mom, right before heading to the airport.\n\nMy mom, who is usually quite a fussy eater, said this was the best meal she had during her entire week in HCM! I was so proud to take her there, and we both enjoyed it to the fullest before our flight.\n\nShop atmosphere ‚Äì As soon as you enter, you‚Äôll notice a strong, distinct condiment aroma in the air. It really sets the tone before you even start eating. The shop itself has plenty of seating whether you come for lunch or dinner. I went there twice and both times were great.\n\nTaste ‚Äì Like I mentioned, my first encounter with pho was disappointing, but this place completely changed my perspective. This is what authentic pho really is. As a fellow Southeast Asian, I absolutely loved it‚Äîthe meat, the noodles, and especially the broth. Even now, I‚Äôm already missing it as I write this!",

The pho, specifically the special (45.000ƒë) was very tasty and we ended up with a full belly and big smile. We ordered drinks twice, and they were out of some, so the owner went quickly to buy some more for us. After we were finished and had paid, it started pouring (raining) A LOT and we were offered to stay there for a while. However, we wanted to go back to the hotel, and because we were carrying all our luggage (3 backpacks and one suitcase) the owner took the motorbike, ran to the closest store while raining and brought us 4 raincoats. He was the kindest!! I tried to pay him back but he would only refuse.\n\nSo, in a nutshell, the food is a 10/10 and the family who manage the restaurant are the nicest ever!!",

English communication was no issue at all.\nThe menu had some interesting options and I chose the wagyu beef pho.\nStrong but definitely not overpowering flavors from the broth and garlic chips. I do recommend to not let the garlic chips sit too long in the broth. The beef is stir fried and has a nice flavor while being very tender. It does not need any dipping sauce as it would probably ruin the flavor.\nThe portion is smaller and pricier compared to your typical pho place. But the thing is you get a more relaxing/cozy environment to dine in and the quality of the ingredients are higher.",

The setting is modest, embodying the essence of local street food culture, which only adds to its charm. Despite its simplicity, the quality of the food rivals that of more renowned establishments in the city.\n\nWhether you‚Äôre a local or a traveler, a visit to Pho Ngoc promises not just a meal, but a memorable experience filled with genuine hospitality and some of the best pho Saigon has to offer.",

Also, the chili sauce they have is very good. Not that typical overly sweet chemical-looking chili sauce you find everywhere.\n\nThe atmosphere and service were nothing to write about.

The reason I'd give it four instead of five stars is that the composition of the bowl just was not perfect. There wasn't enough green in my bowl and there were far too many noodles. Still worth a visit if you're in the area. One more minor criticism, it took about five times as long for our pho to arrive at our table as it does in any other venue.",

The reason is because when I was in Saigon around a decade ago, my first beef pho which my Vietnamese friends brought me to was this place.\n\nAnd after 10+more years I found the taste is what I have been missing all this years. So good to be reunited to this taste, this experience and the memories!\n\nThe broth was excellent, the meat was tender and fresh and the abundance of herbs which was provided made my day. (I love places who do not stinge on these)\n\nOverall, it‚Äôs a good bowl of pho and I‚Äôm so glad I had this before I flew back home.\nIt‚Äôs a 10/10 for me; the shop is located in a very busy road and I took a Grab to come here.\n\nIf I do come back to this awesome city, I‚Äôll definitely come back here for my bowl of goodness!",

That just didn't sit right with me, as that item was 4x the price of everything else on the menu. The facilities are also not the cleanest, I spotted a huge roach in the washroom.

Meat is tender and beef balls are chewy with nice texture.\n\nPrice is fair for the quality of the food. It‚Äôs around 55 - 90k depending on what you‚Äôre getting in your pho.\n\nThe main reason I gave a 3 star is due to sanitary issues. Seeing a cockroach crawl across the table you eat on isn‚Äôt pleasant to say the least. The interior looks decently clean but it was an unexpected event for me.\n\nI‚Äôve been here a lot so it may be due to the glass door being propped open. In any case, the food is worth coming here for but don‚Äôt expect this place to be perfectly clean.",

While we were very hungry, none of us could finish our bowl, it was the worst beef noodle I ever had for years, to the point that I am confident if this restaurant is in a Viet area in Sydney, it would be out of business in months. To make the experience worst, the waiters were talking loudly, using language like a bunch of holidays.\nI am amazed at how Le made it into the Michelin guide, and seems to be quite popular with the local.

The tables are clean and staff are friendly towards tourist. In relation to the food, the broth is heavy, sweet and full of various spices. The Pho Dac Biet contains one of the most generous amount of beef slices - with thick cuts and crunchy tendons. There are also a large plate of fresh herbs that come on the side as well. If you want to enjoy a traditional Southern Style pho, and want to step away from the relatively busier District 1 - I highly recommend you to visit and also try the egg with beef soup. üëçüòã",

The Pho noodle was quite simple, but the noodle itself is a bit different from others, and specially the soup is so nice. It looks very normal Pho noodle, but it tastes better than the others. I got rolaw beef Pho noodle and cost me 70KVND. It may be normal price these days, so better to try here.",

Compared to Pho Khoi which is basically next door, the soup here falls a bit short but has better meat; both are however top quality pho.\n\nThe place is at near the entrance after turning into an alley and is a bit small. The food however is well worth it.\n\nAs of right now, this is my go-to place for pho.",

It‚Äôs very filling, and the portion is so big that one person might not even be able to finish it!\nü•¨ My only small drawback is that the pickled vegetables are on the sweet side. Personally, I prefer them more sour as it helps cut through the richness.\n\nüë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ After dining in, we also ordered a couple more to take away for the family, and everyone was satisfied.\n\nüì¶ I was pleasantly surprised by the takeaway packaging. Instead of just paper bags, they use proper boxes, and even separate the herbs and pickled vegetables individually ‚Äî very neat, clean, and thoughtful.\n\nüí∞ Small size is 50,000 VND, big size is 75,000 VND. Considering the District 1 location, portion, and packaging, I think the price is reasonable.\n\nOverall, it‚Äôs a very good b√°nh m√¨ experience.

I noticed the employee measured my x√¥i and take out a little piece of it, felt a bit sad but at least i know im getting the same amount with everyone. Nothing special about the x√¥i, 15k but usually 10k is the common price. They also have the vegeterian x√¥i option. The package came with a toothpick. Id say this place is a not too bad.",

Service here was very good - very friendly and courteous. The dining ambience - well, it is your typical Vietnamese beside the road low seating; but I am not complaining.

This place has excellent fare.  What makes it good? Delicious fresh bread a perfect light crisp in outside and fresh lightly chewy inside. Fillings like beef skewers and chicken that are well marinated and juicy. The condiments are varied and house made and the veggie fillings inside are very fresh. If you're not a cilantro or hot pepper fan, those are on the side so you can add it if you are a fan! Your hands stay clean because they give you gloves for when all that ooey goodness spills out of your sandwich while you devour it.   Totally recommend.",

After trying, I told the staff, the food beside their stall is good, but your Banh mi is better, and I have no idea why so many people preferred the stall beside them??? If happen you come here, hope you can try both and judge for yourself. There is a saying by Bruce Lee, he fear not one who knows many but fear those who practice a key 10000 times. Lol. When you come here, you will know what I mean.",

The shop is clean and spacious, with friendly staff and fast service. You can order your b√°nh m√¨ to go or sit down and enjoy it with a cup of coffee or tea.\n\nThe b√°nh m√¨ here is delicious and authentic, with a variety of fillings to choose from. You can have the classic b√°nh m√¨ th·ªãt (meat), b√°nh m√¨ pate (pate), b√°nh m√¨ tr·ª©ng (egg), or try something different like b√°nh m√¨ h√° c·∫£o x√≠u m·∫°i (dumplings and meatballs). The bread is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, the meat is tender and flavorful, the pate is rich and creamy, and the vegetables are fresh and crunchy. The shop also offers some sauces and condiments to spice up your b√°nh m√¨, such as chili sauce, soy sauce, or mayonnaise.\n\nIf you are looking for a satisfying and tasty b√°nh m√¨ experience in qu√¢n 3, you should definitely check out B√°nh m√¨ Hanoi. It is a place that will make you fall in love with b√°nh m√¨ all over again.",

Desperately looking for supper, then I come across this road side Banh Mi stall and decided to give it a try.\nSurprisingly, the quality of Banh Mi of this stall is so nice and the price is almost half. Just 40k. The famous stall selling 73k...\nAnd most importantly, this stall is open untill midnight, which you can have it as supper.\nThe location of this stall is just located beside the roundaabout and its just a small stall.\nDefinitely worth a try if you looking for banh mi midnight.\nGood job, boss.",

So we had it in 4 different places in Hanoi, Hoi An & Ho Chi Minh City, including the famous B√°nh MiÃÄ Ph∆∞·ª£ng. I have no doubts that the Mix Banh we had at Banh Mi Oanh was best of the bunch. The filling, which had both pork & chicken, was plentiful. Along with usual sauces, sprinkle of pieces of hot chillies added an extra punch. An extremely good deal for price of 35k VND. She was also thoughtful enough to make separate packing for one chicken only bread that we had packed.",

Had vegan meat, tofu, lettuce, basil, tomatoes. Really good banh mi, and definitely one of the best places to get vegan banh mi in the city! Although it is a bit more ‚Äòpricier‚Äô than other vegan banh mi in the city/the standard price in general. But still worth it.\n\nThe bubble tea I had was ok, but as dairy-free option isn‚Äôt widely available for bubble tea (I think), it‚Äôs great to find a vegan option here.

      "comment": "\"A unique b√°nh m√¨,\" they said. Sure, on paper it is. But if you were to blindfold me and ask me to tell a difference between this and any other cold-cut b√°nh m√¨, I wouldn't be able to tell.\n\nI went early morning to grab one for breakfast so there was no wait. The prices seem to have gone up slightly for everything. The small is now 38K & the large is 59K. Honestly, the prices are not bad for how big the portion sizes are. The small is bigger than the average b√°nh m√¨ you'd find in most street stalls & is more than enough (or even a little too much) for the average Vietnamese' appetite.\n\nTaste-wise, however, it was a bit of a letdown. Was it bad by any means? No. In fact, I found it quite solid... as any other solid cold-cut b√°nh m√¨ you'd find out there in HCMC (which are plenty). Its one advertised unique aspect, the c·ªëm butter, absolutely did not come through at all, not even a hint, when eaten together with everything else as a whole sandwich. The pate was the dominant flavor. When I tried the c·ªëm butter on its own, it tasted like the pork floss that was directly placed on top of it instead. Speaking of which, their pork floss was really good & apparently they have 2 kinds, a regular and a fried-shallots one which you have to specifically request since they don't tell you about it lol\n\nNow, I ordered the regular b√°nh m√¨ without adding anything extra so I thought maybe the problem would be solved if you ordered extra c·ªëm butter. However, someone I know ordered theirs with extra butter and they still had the exact same experience except they could actually taste the nice c·ªëm flavor when they tried just the butter on its own. What I'm gathering from that is that maybe the best way to experience this unique c·ªëm butter on a b√°nh m√¨ is to just get it separately on its own and put it on a plain b√°nh m√¨ and enjoy.\n\nFor the price and the portion size, I wasn't mad at what I got. I would probably revisit just to do the hack I mentioned. But if you're hoping to experience a cool gimmicky b√°nh m√¨ like me, this isn't worth it. Again, it's not bad, just nothing special.",

      "comment": "Today, I had a chance to try the famous Banh Mi Nhu Lan, and it did not disappoint! I ordered two types of sandwiches: the fresh baguette with braised pork and the fresh baguette with xiu mai (Vietnamese meatballs). Both were delicious and left a strong impression. The fresh baguette was soft and chewy, providing a perfect base for the flavorful fillings.\n\nThe braised pork was tender and well-seasoned, melting in my mouth with each bite. It paired beautifully with the fresh bread, making every bite rich and satisfying. The xiu mai, on the other hand, had a delightful savory taste with a hint of sweetness, just the way it should be. Each xiu mai meatball was juicy, tender, and full of flavor.\n\nPrices here are reasonable for the quality; the fresh baguettes are 40,000 VND, while the regular baguettes are 30,000 VND. Both options offer great value for a delicious and filling meal.\n\nOverall, Banh Mi Nhu Lan lives up to its reputation. With fresh ingredients, balanced flavors, and a fair price, this place is a must-visit for any Banh Mi lover. The variety and quality make it worth coming back to explore more flavors!",

      "comment": "One of the best Bahn mi places I've tried in HCMC. They've a lot of options for meat lovers and was absolutely delighted to find out that they have vegetarian options as well. I had the mushroom Bahn mi and it was delicious. I'd say the size of the bahn mi is just right for a proper meal. They also didn't skimp on the fillings. We also tried the vegetarian spring rolls which was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. They were both flavorful and I enjoyed every bit of it. Ms. Quy, the owner was also very warm and accommodating. Definitely a must try Bahn Mi place if you visit HCMC! And for the price and quality of the food, I am definitely coming back for more!",

I was back the following morning for the Egg Banh Mi and was impressed with that one too. Run by what seems to be a mother-daughter duo, don‚Äôt be fooled by the tiny shop of this Banh Mi powerhouse.

The fluffy baguette trumps the sticky rice for its subtle sweetness and yeasty aroma it adds to each bite, sandwiching a wonderful balance of ingredients that palates from across the globe have grown to love. The rich savoriness of the meats melded with the mayo, pate, pickled carrots and daikon, cucumbers, and cilantro creates a harmonious experience that's seldom found in Toronto. Sharing many common ingredients like sliced cold cuts and a savoury, rich pate. The addictive glutinous texture serves as an excellent vehicle for the rest of the toppings, too, including a fragrant scallion oil, subtly sweet pork floss, along with crunchy peanuts. I find comfort in knowing great banh mi can be found no matter what district you're in, as this location hits the spot too. It's up to you whether you prefer a coarser, stronger pate and a touch easier on the mayo. The sticky rice even includes Chinese sausage and quail egg.",

Never had a Shredded Chicken Banh Mi before and surely did not disappoint. So a wee nice lady takes your order only saw two choices Grilled Pork or Shredded Chicken. The bread is light and crispy, packed full of chicken, you also can have it spicy. So so good for that price. I believe there a few spots around Saigon. Give it a go and let me know what you think too.",

You have to build your own sandwich from the platter of ingredients: 2 cooked eggs, pate, sausage, cucumber, tomato and a mini baguette.

Rich broth, fresh and spongey fish cake + crunchy fish cake slides, made the bowl feel like a dancing party of taste and texture.\n\nI love the shacha sauce that is slightly sweet, sour, and spicy, paired real well with the already rich broth.\n\nThe additional cabbage side dish complements quite well with the bowl of noodle, making the dish whole and nutritious.\n\nI like vibe, it's giving a failed coffee shop turned Noodle place, and they succeed in making that attractive, tasteful bowl of noodle. They didn't focus on the design, more so the food just so you know.\n\nPrice is very district 1 (mid-high), but the look of the place, and the portion will justify why.",

The shop is very small comparing to the popularity, so you may have a seat with someone. It's quite normal in Vietnam. Anyway the Bun noodle looks very simple and normal, but the soup and meat were really nice. Simply it tastes very good. The price was 45KVND. The value for the price was also really good here.",

Even though my mum is from the South, she used to make it all the time so I was really craving it.\n\nThe best part about this soup is that it has the scrambled eggs. The broth is clear and flavorful, the shredded chicken, and pork.\n\nI even got an extra side of scrambled eggs.\n\nIt hit the spot. They also sell cha gio and nem which sold out when I went but I‚Äôll come earlier next time to get it. I asked the guy normally what time they sell out and he said around 12pm.\n\nThe only slight let down is that it doesn‚Äôt seat too many people so I imagine it would be super packed in the morning.",

However, it's the owners' secret broth recipe that makes the dishes especially good. You can taste the effort the owners' put into their product. Every ingredient they use is of a very high quality and always super fresh. A great option when you're burned out on ph·ªü. The most expensive thing you can order is only 35,000 VND a bowl (about $1.52 at the time of writing), so it's very reasonably priced in comparison to other broth-meat-noodle dishes.",

There‚Äôs a huge selection of veggies to add in and most importantly, service is quick üëç\n\nMy only reason for leaving 4 star was because the interior was a bit warm. I know we were eating hotpot, but I wish the AC was turned on a bit more so the air could be a little cooler.

However, the toppings don't stop, the crab meatballs have a subtle seafood sweetness, plus the slices of brisket, rare beef and snappy tendons. Its neutral beef flavour is heightened with your choice of condiments, from a classic fish sauce, chili salt, or fermented fish sauce to elevate your bite. They'll bring a serving of Vietnamese yogurt unprompted, renowned for its silky smooth and light mouthfeel, with a more pronounced tang and sweetness than what I know in the West. Just remember, you'll have to pay for it.",

      "comment": "I was really excited to try this place. I had pho in a stone bowl but never bbh in a stone before. I ordered the special and opted no pork bone. Soup was scorching hot as expected. The beef that it came with was very chewy but I didn‚Äôt expect great beef in Vietnam. Soup was flavourful but in the fattier side. There were a lot innards which I didn‚Äôt eat and had to throw it out. I did give it a try but it tasted ‚Äòdirty‚Äô. Maybe it was a bad day for them or I wasn‚Äôt feeling it. I was expecting a lot and felt it was just average. Random spots that sells bbh tasted better in my opinion. Still good but not great.",

But once I sampled the first spoon I realized half an hour walk under the scorching Saigon sun looking for C√¥ 4 was worth it .  I meant. looking for her b√∫n m·∫Øm !\n\nMy journey began in H√† N·ªôi , and there I sampled ph·ªü b√≤ , ph·ªü g√† , b√∫n ·ªëc , b√∫n thang , b√∫n m·ªçc ... they're all good .  Then I moved south to Hu·∫ø ... and here I agree with Anthony Bourdain admiration for b√∫n b√≤ Hu·∫ø , it is special . Very special !\n\nBut deep down inside my gut is telling me that Anthony Bourdain never had the opportunity to meet C√¥ 4 and sample her b√∫n m·∫Øm mi·ªÅn T√¢y.  If he had I am sure he will agree with me : of all the noodle soup under the sky , Numero uno is b√∫n m·∫Øm mi·ªÅn T√¢y ... and number 2 is b√∫n b√≤ Hu·∫ø ... and all the others fight among themselves for number 3 !",

      "comment": "**B√∫n Qu·∫≠y** is a unique and flavorful noodle dish originating from Ph√∫ Qu·ªëc Island in Vietnam. What sets it apart from other noodle soups is the way it‚Äôs prepared and served. The name \"qu·∫≠y\" means \"stirring,\" referring to the interactive dining experience where diners mix their own ingredients into the broth.\n\nThe dish typically consists of fresh rice noodles served in a light, clear broth, accompanied by freshly ground seafood such as shrimp, fish paste, and squid. The process begins with the customer stirring these ingredients into the hot broth at the table, allowing the flavors to meld together. The broth, though simple, becomes rich and flavorful as the seafood cooks and releases its essence.\n\nA key element of **B√∫n Qu·∫≠y** is the spicy dipping sauce, made from fish sauce, chili, lime, sugar, and sometimes fresh herbs. Diners often add this sauce to the bowl to adjust the flavor to their liking, making each bite customizable. The dish is light, fresh, and perfect for seafood lovers seeking an authentic and interactive Vietnamese culinary experience.\n\n**B√∫n Qu·∫≠y** has gained popularity beyond Ph√∫ Qu·ªëc, thanks to its fresh ingredients, DIY preparation, and distinctive flavors.",

Mix half of the dipping sauce given to you into the soup. Then just taste the broth to see if it's up to your kind of saltiness and flavor.\nI personally don't like the beef. It's chewy to me. The fish and shrimp is not a piece of meat it's like a paste thing. It's pretty good and soft.\nOverall, I enjoy this noodle style and will come back again.",

      "comment": "The constant buzz of customers is a testament to how good this eatery is. The dish itself is simple: clear, light broth that might not be for those who crave bolder flavours.\n\nI personally love the option with two types of toppings, ground filleted fish and prawn. Once my bowl arrives, I customise it to perfection: a sprinkle of black pepper, a handful of fresh veggies, and a scoop of their signature kumquat chilli salt. And with each bite of noodles, I add a touch of their unique sauce for an extra flavour boost.\n\nThe service is speedy and efficient, but due to the popularity, sometimes sharing a table with friendly strangers is also a part of the experience.",

The sauce is on the side and the instructions on the wall - add pepper, add half a tablespoon of the sauce to the dish to mix, then add a bit of sauce to every mouthful. If you're every ordering in Vietnam, look for \"Dac Biet\" on the menu - it literally means special or gimme a bit of everything.  Highly recommended!!

This place is very good care and good  hygiene as well, you will not step any oily floor and bone or food waste on the floor. The staff is well trained and friendly as well.

It was really delicious with the veggies they have on the side. They have sauce that you add into the broth too so don‚Äôt forget to add those. The broth was very flavorful with the peanuts that they added. They give quite good amount of seafood and quail eggs.\n\nBe careful if you‚Äôre allergic to peanuts. Be careful because they charge for each wet wipes you take. They also serve Nem Nuong but they only serve it later in the afternoon. The lady suggested to break black sesame chips in the soup and eat it together. She doesn‚Äôt speak English at all but she‚Äôs super friendly and still will serve you. Many local come by to eat all the time so come check it out!",

I ordered from the establishment a total of 2 times before I stopped going there.\n\nThe first time I ate there, I had 2 buns and an iced coffee. The buns tasted nice but had gone cold as they were left exposed to the air conditioning. The iced coffee was good and they served it to my table.\n\nThe second time I went there, I ordered take away as I was on the way to work and wanted a quick breakfast. The cashier at the counter didn‚Äôt have gloves on and was sticking her hand into the plastic to put the bun in. Later, when she was taking payment, she used the same hand to handle the cash and cash register. Absolutely horrifying. If I was ordering food from a street vendor, I would accept it. However, since this is an established chain that is charging a premium, basic hygiene is expected from the staff.\n\nThat was the last time I visited Tous Les Jours as if the staff were this unhygienic in front of the customers, I can‚Äôt imagine what goes on in the kitchen. Anyways, the buns are quite underwhelming as they‚Äôre left sitting out in the cold since morning.",

This was the point it went downhill as I waited about 20 mins for the coffee to be made. The drinks orders go straight to a separate area from the till, but  with online orders coming in for uber collections they get pushed down the queue so it takes ages! We chased the drinks up twice before they finally arrived! I'd suggest ordering drinks immediately you arrive before then choosing what to eat and it might work better!\nWe came back 2 days later for a take-away pastry to be heated up. Again, the few minutes they said it would be became about 15, but the pastry was delicious! You just need patience here üòÜ",

I ordered a slice of pizza without knowing the ingredients, when I understood it was made by pork meat, I did not eat this pizza and I ordered another vegan bun. Surprisingly the beautiful shopkeeper girl provided me a delicious vegan bun and its totally free of cost. She really made my day. If I get an opportunity to visit Ho Chi Minh city once again surely I will visit her shop again. Thank you dear, best wishes.",

The store accepted my order, then messaged to say the item was out of stock and insisted I must choose something else. I politely declined and asked to cancel, but they tried to push me to change the order ‚Äúto help the store‚Äù ‚Äî which was a very strange request.\n\nI asked again to cancel, but they said it was not possible. I tried again and they stated that it was now too late because the driver had arrived. The driver also messaged, saying the owner wanted me to choose something else. Before I could even respond, they packed a different item without my consent and sent it out.\n\nI tried the replacement, but it wasn‚Äôt good at all and the whole thing ended up in the bin. Very disappointed overall. I won‚Äôt be ordering from here again. Night ruined.\n\nUPDATE:\nStore has tried to report me to Grab so I have attached the conversation as evidence. The food may be great here, I just had a bad experience.\n\nI didn't receive a photo of the replacement and as I had no choice I had requested something sweet as a last minute decision. The driver said when he arrived they already had something packed, however it was not sweet.",

Everything was absolutely delicious and beautifully presented. The staff were wonderful, friendly, and always smiling.

Each creation feels deliberate yet effortless: croissants that flake like morning light, tarts that glow with freshness, and cakes that balance refinement with emotion.\n\nWhat makes Ivoire unforgettable is its curiosity ‚Äî the way French technique embraces local soul. You might find a pandan croissant, a persimmon cake that tastes like autumn, or the cheeky B∆†nana pudding printed with eatable ink. Every season brings a new surprise, yet the spirit stays the same: graceful, modern, and deeply personal.\n\nAt Ivoire, innovation never overshadows warmth ‚Äî it simply reminds you that even perfection can evolve.",

Many are in trompe l‚Äôoeil style. The pastries are very nice as well but their patisserie is a do not miss. They have not many tables but the turnover is ok, we always manage to get the table.",

The croissant with avocado cream is surprisingly delicious with a cold filling and warm and flaky dough. Shijuso is a mix between Japanese cheesecake and sponge cake, which is delightful to eat. I'm a little bit disappointed with tiramisu because mille crepe as the base makes it not as interesting as soaked ladyfingers even though it has good and strong cocoa and espresso flavor. Service is top tier. Matcha and hojicha beverages are as good as expected.",

The dishes I ordered are mostly baked dishes, then entremet dishes and I am very satisfied with the perfection, the sophistication in every detail and especially in the texture and filling of the cake. Everything is perfectly balanced. What I like most about the baked croissants is that they use a type of butter that rarely gains weight, and the taste is very delicious along with the perfect texture of each layer of cake and a lot of filling. This is a commendable point. For the entremet dishes, I am very satisfied with the story of each cake and the health benefits of each layer of filling in the entremet. This is not only delicious, beautiful but also very attentive to the health of consumers, this is the heart of the baker that I rarely see in other bakeries. I rarely eat cakes but the story of The Vagabond has attracted me. October is coming, a special day, and I think I have chosen a perfect place to celebrate now. Thank you, The Vagabond and wish you all the best!",

They offer a variety of beautifully crafted pastries, from their signature ribbon pies to the soft and flaky 32 layered tissue bread available in plain and matcha. Everything is well presented and feels fresh from the oven.\n\nThey also have a great selection of cakes, both classic and creative, I spotted fruit topped sponges, chocolate ganache, and even a fun bear-shaped cake in the display fridge. It‚Äôs hard not to be impressed by the visual appeal. Whether you‚Äôre after something sweet or savory, you‚Äôll likely find something that suits your mood.\n\nThe atmosphere is modern and inviting, with an upstairs seating area that‚Äôs quiet and comfortable, perfect for relaxing with a coffee and pastry. Staff were friendly, and despite the steady flow of customers, service was efficient.\n\nI love starting my day with one of their buttery croissants or a jumbo ribbon pie, paired with a coffee.

The moment you walk in, you‚Äôre greeted by the rich aroma of freshly-baked pastries and breads, all presented with care and attention to detail. Each item is flavorful and satisfying, reflecting the bakery‚Äôs emphasis on quality ingredients and traditional techniques.\n\nThe interior design is particularly noteworthy. With a touch of medieval charm blended into a more modern layout, the space feels both elegant and comfortable. It creates a distinctive environment that‚Äôs perfect for casual visits or relaxing with a warm drink.\n\nThe service is consistently pleasant, with friendly staff who are welcoming and quick to assist. Their polite demeanor enhances the overall experience and adds a personal touch to each visit.\n\nHowever, one noticeable drawback is the cleanliness of the dining area. On several occasions, floors and tables appeared unclean or poorly maintained, which detracts from the otherwise polished impression of the store.\n\nIn conclusion, Tous Les Jours stands out for its delicious baked goods, charming atmosphere, and kind service. With improved attention to cleanliness, it could truly offer an exceptional experience from start to finish.",

If you want to try their tart cake, you'll need to visit their Xuan Thuy, Thao Dien store, as it's exclusive there.\n\nSo, I decided to try the tiramisu gold version instead, and I actually loved it. It's way better than any other tiramisu I've ever tried‚Äînot too sweet, not too rich, and the cream is very well-balanced.\n\nI also tried some other fruit cakes, but while the best thing about them is that they're less sugary and not overly sweet, the taste was just average.\n\nIf you're looking for something special, the tiramisu gold version is definitely the highlight here.",

Tiramisu is one of the better flavor but still not enough coffee  and alcohol taste. Chocolate mint is disappointing. Guava berry is better than blueberry. Not worth the price.",

We wandered in and had a look and were impressed with the cleanliness, the extensive variety of pastries, cakes etc, and the eatery which is on the left side of the bakery. We decide to grab a bite to eat and a cold iced tea each and WOW, were we impressed, extremely happy with the dishes served, the attentive staff and service. Prices were good, food was quality and tasty. Couldn't been happier. Highly recommend this establishment for locals and especially for foreigners. Thanks Teo for being a place where I can trust the food to be of high quality. And thanks to the staff who were all helpful and pleasant to interact with.",

      "comment": "Before I start my review I actually want to highlight a few of the ridiculous 1 star ratings that are unfair. I‚Äôve browsed through and realize that many have complained about the quality of the baked goods. Let me break this down for those who are visiting Vietnam so you aren‚Äôt mistaken. Just like in the United States, this shop actually circulates out their old baked goods every 2-3hours. That means if the product isn‚Äôt gone within 2 or 3 hours, they throw it out and make a new batch. However some have complained about the poor quality of the sandwiches and such. That‚Äôs only because they chose the bread at the end of the hour.\n\nAlright, now my review. The first thing I want to highlight, which I didn‚Äôt see much of in the posts. Is the motorbike security. They are an excellent addition to such a clean and fast paced store. They help you get in and out as quickly and politely as possible. Much respect!\n\nThe store itself is cramped, with almost no moving space if it‚Äôs lunch time or filled with more than 7 people. The sad part is, the baking team and cashier girls don‚Äôt do such a great job communicating. So it‚Äôs very hectic when there‚Äôs a crowd. The croissants, donuts and variety of cakes are incredible! However, I really wish the Vietnamese populace wasn‚Äôt so disgusting and pushy. I‚Äôve seen a few people touch some bread with their hands then put it back. This frustrates me to no end. They have TONGS for a reason. In any case, A+ for the massive selection and great taste. D grade for a poor group of staff that doesn‚Äôt operate well under pressure.\n\nAll in all, I gave this place a 4 star. Because they do an excellent job of providing tasty desserts!\n\nOh and the moon cakes I bought are only for limited time. So if you‚Äôre reading this review after the festival, it means they no longer have it üòé",

Went in to buy a birthday cake for someone else but needed a different person to choose from the options they had. Immediately after taking out my phone, I was approached to say I can't take any pictures. Sorry but your designs aren't that nice or unique that anyone is going to steal them. In fact they look like just about any bake shop from the 80s-90s with really cheap decorations. Get over yourselves, you aren't special at all. Also keep in mind that people can take pictures after they buy, so you really aren't accomplishing anything except being rude to your customers that are shopping in your store with this rule.",

They have many customers so I needed to order in advance. All their products were new and they sold out everyday. The pastry was most delicious when it was hot. The box looked very traditional. The cake was not very sweet and very balanced with the sweet filling and bland crust. I bought the kind with 1 salt egg and 2 kinds of filling. 1 was mung beans and the other was taro.

The soft texture was straight from the fridge meaning there was no butter Incorporated into the cake. The sponge cake itself is lightly sweet and somewhat eggy and there is a thin layer of peanut butter and jelly in the center, where the jam was a bit tangy while the peanut butter faded into the background.",

      "comment": "My sister and I recently stumbled upon this delightful bakery that I just had to share with everyone. Tucked away in a charming corner, it's incredibly easy to find. From the moment you step inside, you're greeted with a sense of warmth and comfort. The bakery is impeccably clean, with a bright and inviting atmosphere that instantly puts you at ease.\n\nOne thing that immediately caught my eye was the vast array of beautifully crafted pastries on display. From delicate tarts to indulgent cakes, the selection was simply mesmerizing. I couldn't resist picking up a Fuji cake and a rainbow roll cake to enjoy on the spot. And let me tell you, they did not disappoint.\n\nBut the real star of the show was the special cake I ordered for the next day. The pandan cake was a revelation ‚Äì soft, fragrant, and infused with the subtle aroma of pandan leaves. While it leaned slightly towards the sweeter side for my taste, the flavor was so rich and nuanced that I found myself savoring every bite. It was unlike anything I had ever tasted before ‚Äì a harmonious blend of flavors and textures that left me speechless. The cake was moist, bursting with flavor, and expertly balanced in sweetness. Each bite was a symphony of taste, and I found myself longing for more long after the last crumb had disappeared.\n\nConsidering the quality of the pastries and the reasonable prices, I truly believe this bakery offers exceptional value for money. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone looking for a memorable dessert experience. Whether you're a connoisseur of sweets or simply looking to satisfy a craving, this place has something for everyone. Trust me, you won't be disappointed!",

It can be a big mess traffic since there are motorcycles cut in and out. Well, the bakery was quite good at a good price compare to Mr. Cake. Wide selections of cakes, breads and buns. I usually just get a pack of 5 mini pork floss buns for 30k VND. There cranberries cheese bread is good, so as their Almond buns. The staffs can be a little unfriendly, they not talk to you or ask you what you need, they just stand there and look at you.. hahaha",

The bakery has a great choice for eating areas, with an upstairs outside view, great for observing the busy neighbourhood, and traffic. Together with a great choice of beverage, (my favorite being the blueberry yogurt smoothie) and with a reasonable price attached to the highest of quality products, this place is easily HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",
